There are five "regions" of memory

Code
Read-Only Data
Global Data
Heap
Stack

Code: What you are seeing here
Read-Only Data: Constants are here
Global Data: Mutable variables are here

int a = 0; global
const b = 1; read-only

Stack: A local space for a function.
    When the function returns, the stack "disappear".
